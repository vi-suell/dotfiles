# My Configuration for Neovim

This repository holds my neovim configuration.

## Inspiration

This configuration was shamelessly stolen from:

TJDevries >  https://www.youtube.com/@teej_dv (Advent of Neovim, kickstart.nvim)

MrJakob  > https://www.youtube.com/@MrJakob (Neovim from scratch)

DreamsofCode > https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io/DreamNvim/
